Gerrit Events[![Release Drafter](https://github.com/faktorzehn/gerrit-events/actions/workflows/release-drafter.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/faktorzehn/gerrit-events/actions/workflows/release-drafter.yml) [![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/faktorzehn/gerrit-events/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/faktorzehn/gerrit-events/actions/workflows/maven.yml)
=============

**This library is primarily intended as a dependency for our fork of the [jira-gerrit-plugin](https://github.com/faktorzehn/jira-gerrit-plugin).**
It adds support for fetching changes from Gerrit's rest-api through a ``GerritQueryHandlerHttp``-class. This class closely follows
the structure of the already existing ``GerritQueryHandler``- and ``GerritQueryHandlerWithPersistedConnection``-class.
The added functionality is fully tested.

This is a Java library used primarily to listen to [stream-events](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.8.1/cmd-stream-events.html) from [Gerrit Code Review](https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/) and to send reviews via the SSH CLI or the REST API.
It was originally a module in the [Jenkins Gerrit Trigger plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gerrit-trigger-plugin) and is now broken out to be used in other tools without the dependency to Jenkins.

Most of the development will still target the Jenkins plugin, but now it can also be used elsewhere.

# Usage
A "real life" example of usage can be found in the [Jenkins Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gerrit-trigger-plugin/blob/master/gerrithudsontrigger/src/main/java/com/sonyericsson/hudson/plugins/gerrit/trigger/GerritServer.java#L408).

Start by creating a connection, attach some utility listeners and a GerritHandler.

```java
connection = new GerritConnection(name, config);
GerritHandler handler = new GerritHandler();
handler.setIgnoreEMail(name, config.getGerritEMail());
connection.setHandler(handler);
connection.addListener(gerritConnectionListener);
connection.start();
```

The handler handles the event routing and a thread pool to try to keep up with the potentially
huge amount of events coming from Gerrit. One handler can route from several connections.

Then create your event listener. The *GerritEventListener* interface requires you to implement one method
called *gerritEvent* that takes a parameter of type *GerritEvent* which is the base class for all events.
You can implement any number of *gerritEvent* methods that takes more specific event classes as its one parameter.
The handler will use reflection to try to find the most suitable method to call and will fall back to the generic one if it can't find any.

```java
public class MyEventListener implements GerritEventListener {
    @Override
    public void gerritEvent(GerritEvent event) {
        //Do something...
    }

    public void gerritEvent(PatchsetCreated event) {
        //Do something when someone uploads a patchset...
    }
}
```

```java
handler.addListener(new MyEventListener());
```

All event types can be found in the [com.sonymobile.tools.gerrit.gerritevents.dto.events](https://github.com/sonyxperiadev/gerrit-events/tree/master/src/main/java/com/sonymobile/tools/gerrit/gerritevents/dto/events) package.


# Environments
* `linux`
    * `java-1.8`
        * `maven-3.5.4`

Java 8 & 9: Works.

The maintainers' development, tests and production environments are
Ubuntu 12.04 so we have no means of detecting or fixing any Windows issues,
but there are no specific reasons why it shouldn't run on Windows
and some kind contributors provide win fixes every now and then.

# Discarding events
You can create a whitelist of projects from which you want to consider events from. This will prevent operations on projects that you do not wish to view events from taking up resources. This is especially useful when a large Gerrit server is used and you are only trying to evaluate events for a small subset of projects. 

You can set where the file is expected by setting the environment variable **gerrit.whitelist.location** to the file location. 

 An example file: 
 
 ```ini
#simple txt file with each project on newline
foo
```

This will result in only events from the foo project being evaluated further. 

The file can be updated and is polled every 30 minutes by default. This polling interval can be set with **gerrit.whitelist.timeout**. 


# Build
You build using maven

    mvn clean package

Run findbugs for future reference
or to make sure you haven't introduced any new warnings
